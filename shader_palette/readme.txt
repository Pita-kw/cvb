This resource does exactly what enbseries palette effect does.
Supports any enb palette bitmap.

Uploaded it for those wanting to create their own shader system or
just adding a bit of atmosphere on their servers.

It's fairly easy to add other post process effects. And that's
all up to You.

That's it.
